How to use
* Start app with `python app.py` OR `flask run`
* Done :)

`test.py` is a sample script which sends a POST request to `\predict` (our REST API endpoint)
* Edit `path` variable to the path of an existing image (or use the sample image found in `image/1.jpg`)
* Run `python test.py > out.json`
* Output json will be found in `out.json`
